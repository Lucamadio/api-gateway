# Logging Requests and Responses - Example

Membrane can log the body and header fields of requests and responses.


## Running the Example

In this example we will visit a web site and take a look at the logs in the console. 

1. Go to the `examples/logging` directory.
2. Execute in a terminal window:

    `service-proxy.bat` or `service-proxy.sh`

3. Open in the browser:
   
    `http://localhost:2000` 

4. Take a look at the output of the console where you started Membrane.


#### Troubleshooting:

If Membrane does not generate any output after loading a URL, it is possible that your browser has already cached the resource.
